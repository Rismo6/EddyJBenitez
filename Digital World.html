  <a>Title: Damn We Look Good<br>

    Dimensions: 1920px x 1080px
    <br>Medium: Photoshop<br><br>
    
    Description: I created a photoshop image to picture the long-awaited dream of Virtual Reality. A tribute to gamers all over the world. I met up with a couple of my friends and interviewed them about their most favorite video games or T.V show. I could have just picked a random picture off the internet and photoshop that, but I believed if I took my own photos I would foster creativity. After we had established what their favorite video games were, I picked them up and went to two different locations in Morgan Hill to do a photoshoot. The following images are part of this project: Damn We look Good,The Heart of Jaysen's Kingdom, The Hero Trent and Darb's dream.</a>
  
    
  <a><br></br>Title: Darb's dream<br>
      
      Dimensions: 300px x 296px
      <br>Medium: Photoshop<br></br>
      
      Description: The use of colors and flowers to represent powerful feelings and emotions is an effective rhetorical tool. Pigments create an overwhelming sensation, attracting people, like light attracts moths. To allow the audience to experience the green and red more efficiently, I created a dark background. The negative space takes over the composition, while the linear positive space brings form into existence. The green symbolises youth, growth, and safety. Red symbolises lust, passion and desire. Here the young woman in the composition is in a virtual rhetorical situation. The roses are positioned in different directions of the woman. One rose is behind and one is in front of her. The height level of the roses were also put into considerations. The roses represent her past relationships, as well as her future relationships. In the attempt to move past her latest relationship she struggles to see a bright future for her next one.</a>
  <a><br></br>Title: The Hero Trent<br>

      Dimensions: 720px x 480px<br>
      Medium: Photoshop<br></br>
      
      Description: Trent said he enjoyed playing a Nintendo game titled Super Smash Bros. His favorite game is Earthbound 3 and his favorite show at the time is My Hero Academia. I asked him which one he will enjoy seeing the most, he responded with My Hero Academia. We tried several poses for the picture; we agreed with the superhero landing pose. Because I knew the T.V. show very well I already had an idea on how I wanted the picture to look like. I began by putting his photo in adobe photoshop. I wanted the photo to have a story, so I made it seem as if he jumped out of the sky. Because the character we are trying to imitate is a strength base hero, I made his landing strong and reckless. I made it seem as if the ground was being destroyed by his landing by having rocks shoot up from the ground.</a>

    Title: The Heart of Jaysen's Kingdom<br>

    Dimensions: 720px x 480px<br>
    Medium: Photoshop<br></br>
    
    Description: My second piece is of Jaysen. Jaysen said he enjoyed playing a Blizzard game titled Overwatch. His favorite game is Kingdom Hearts and his favorite show at the time is My Hero Academia as well. I asked him which one he will enjoy seeing the most, he responded with Kingdom Hearts. It was a lot of fun taking his pictures, because the character he was playing as was Sora (the main character of Kingdom Hearts) and he had Soraâ€™s weapon, the key blade. I wanted to make it seem as if Jaysen just entered this new world. The original photo had clear skies and a bright background with a joyful tone, I changed it to a dark tone by changing the contrast and lowering the brightness. I add dark clouds and enemies from the game, Kingdom Hearts, falling out of the clouds. I used the eraser tool and lowered opacity to blend the clouds to the original photo. Sora's companies (Donald Duck and Goofy) were added, because I thought the photo was too much of a plane piece.
