    <br></br>Description: A 26-year-old man from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, is an American rapper, singer, and record producer. His Name is Malcolm James McCormick or better known as Mac Miller. Mac Miller self-taught himself piano, guitar, drums, and bass. When he was in high school he focused less on his school work and more on his rapping career. He made a couple of random mix tapes, but his career didn’t take off till his album Blue Slide Park dropped, on November 8, 2011. A couple years later he had his own T.V. show that aired on M.T.V. Yes his melodies in his music are very nice, but what really made Mac Miller standout from the other rappers is his growth in his albums. Mac Miller had an interview about his life and was asked “why the major tone change in between albums." Mac miller explained that he became a rapper in a very young age, as he matured and changed as an adult so did his albums. First album was about being young and fun, second was about finding out what life is about and what he wants to accomplish, then his third album main focus was clearing himself from toxic drugs and finally his latest album was about what he really wanted in life: love. This doesn’t only express Mac miller, but also helps his fans and listeners. His fan base are mostly teenagers and young adults that are going through the same life changes as Mac miller did. His music touched his fans. I don’t want to make music, but I do want my artwork to have the same effect as Mac Miller had with his music. The following images are part of this project: Untitled #!, and Untitled #@.</div>
