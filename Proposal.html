  ">My project is a fake online post announcing the five new voted winners that will be added to the 7 Wonders of the World list in the year 2021. The United States at the moment is in a pandemic, which the government  was supporting people to stay isolated in their homes away from others. At first, the public’s response to the Government’s request was very cooperative. The quarantine then began to be extended. Isolation creates a lack of community, making people anxious. The only reliable source to satisfy the urge of human interaction being the internet. The Conspiracy theories about the pandemic began to spread almost as fast as the virus, claiming that the government is hiding their true intentions behind the pandemic. Memes about these theories were posted on the internet to express how some theories are more ridiculous than others.<br></br>  
    I chose to make photoshopped images for my project because it's what I believe is the best medium that is able to make something fake look natural and realistic. With how ridiculous these made up sites gets it gets hard and hard to visualize. With photoshop the sites become easier for the audience to recognize and react to. 
    <br></br> 
    The 7 Wonders of the World are a list of architectural monuments and symbols of global heritage. These sites represent the imagination and diligent work only humans who act together  are able to create. People travel from across the world, gather together to celebrate such achievements: the power of a community.<br></br> 
    We grew up communicating and interacting with others, even without physical interaction. This is possible thanks to the use of the internet, which in itself should be considered part of the 7 Wonders of the World. We, as users of the internet, share videos, images, news, and entertainment to other users around the world. One single post on any social media platform can gain thousands of likes or comments. For example, Memes. Meme is by definition an idea, behavior, style, or usage that spreads from person to person within a culture. Through Memes one single person is able to communicate a certain feeling about an idea that is possibly relatable to others who feel the same way. We have all either seen a meme or have attempted to create one.  A group of people don't have to belong in the same culture to have seen a meme, because we divided ourselves into subcultures. Within our multiple cultures we as humans naturally begin to imitate and act alike to gain a sense of belonging. Imitating behaviors help us feel as if we belong and feel united. This is what the internet provides us, especially in the most desperate of times when physical interactions are prohibited.<br></br>
    Now the world is facing a rapidly spreading illness, affecting thousands in multiple regions, Corona. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, coronaviruses are a group of viruses that can infect humans and animals. Their name comes from crown-like spikes on their surface. These viruses can cause a common cold or a more serious disease. We are advised to stay at home away from physical interactions, in the hopes of slowing and stopping the spread of the virus.<br></br>
    I myself, sit alone in my room hoping for the day I can go outside, I look forward to the day I can reconnect, face to face, with friends and loved ones. Traveling isn’t my thing, yet I have begun day dreaming about visiting different locations around the world. I daydream of such things as I sit in front of my computer screen, a tool that allows me to see anything I want. My initial reaction to this after thought was to search for the most visited sites in the world, in which I found an nemours amount of articles about the 7 Wonders of the World. <br></br>   
    These fascinating locations hold gigantic historical monuments, unique in their own way and contain their own culture. An act of acting together. I hope to believe this was one of the oldest types of memes. An ancient way people were able to come together and enjoy their community through relatable culture.<br></br>
