    <div class = "description"><a>Eddy J. Benitez was born in Las Angeles California, but raised in Morgan Hill/Gilroy, California. Video Games such as Roguelike, RPGs, Metroidvanias, Turn based games were introduced to his life at a very young age. Eddy is now in his third year, attempting to achieve his BFA in Digital Media Art at San Jose State. With an interest in Web development he created his own website portfolio, as well as a small demo website for his Fraternity. He is also fiddling with html, css, and Java, but his main career goal is to be an independent game developer.<br><br>

    I have always been the player to follow the instruction “press Start,” now I plan on developing the instruction. With my dedicated passion, I plan on exploring the in and outs of game development.<br><br>
    
    This era of game development is phenomenal. Video Games have been upgrading and evolving since the 90’s. Gamers all over the world have been given games that contain great storylines, amazing graphics, remakes and new in-game mechanics. Veteran gamers could say the gaming industry has taken them through an emotional rollercoaster, with some video games being top-notch to some being the worst things ever created. I believe players are no longer being rewarded by playing the game, but are rewarding the Company. Before dlc, expansion packs, and in-game currency, there was exploration. For example, in the Nintendo series Metroid, the players were rewarded for finding hidden passageways around the map and are rewarded with more in-game content. Triple A companies thrive on shelving vanilla games that have pre planned game contant. Yes, I do agree dlcs are a great way to keep a game from dying and keeping it fresh. But premade dlcs shouldn't be acceptable if the vanilla game had one two many issues.<br><br>
    
    There are a variety of futures in a video game that makes it fun and enjoyable. So much so it seems nearly impossible for just one person to accomplish. I have started my journey to become an Indie game developer and have been practicing ever since I made the decision to become one. I am throwing my hat in the ring and dedicating my work to rewarding the player for playing.</a></div>
